# Template Literal Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Description

The frontend was showing 404 errors because template literals were using single quotes instead of backticks, causing literal strings like `'${API_BASE_URL}'` instead of proper variable interpolation.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/apps/web/pages/ai-resume-builder.tsx`

- Fixed line 155: `axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/ai-resume-builder/templates`)`
- Fixed line 190: `axios.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/ai-resume-builder/generate`)`

### 2. `/apps/web/pages/college/viewstudents.tsx`

- Added missing import: `import { API_BASE_URL } from '../../utils/api';`
- Fixed API call: `axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/students`, { params: { collegeId } })`

### 3. `/apps/web/pages/jobs/create.tsx`

- Added missing import: `import { API_BASE_URL } from '../../utils/api';`
- Fixed API call: `axios.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/jobs`, jobData, {`

### 4. `/apps/web/pages/admin/index.tsx`

- Fixed two API calls:
  - `axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/admin/dashboard/stats`)`
  - `axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/admin/pending-approvals`)`

## Verification

✅ All template literal patterns searched and fixed
✅ No remaining instances of `'${API_BASE_URL}'` found
✅ Required imports added for API_BASE_URL
✅ Code successfully committed and deployed
✅ GitHub Actions deployment completed successfully

## Expected Results

- Resume builder should now work without 404 errors
- Admin dashboard should load stats and approvals
- Job creation should work properly
- College student views should display correctly
- All API calls should resolve to: `campuspe-api-staging-hmfjgud5c6a7exe9.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net`

## Next Steps

1. Test the resume builder functionality
2. Verify OTP delivery with WABB webhook integration
3. Confirm all API endpoints are working correctly

## Technical Notes

- Template literals in JavaScript/TypeScript must use backticks (`) not single quotes (')
- The syntax should be: `${variable}` not `'${variable}'`
- This was causing literal string interpolation instead of variable substitution
