## üö® URGENT: Azure Permissions Fixed + Manual Environment Variable Setup Required

### ‚úÖ **PERMISSIONS ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: `AuthorizationFailed - does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Web/sites/config/list/action'`

**‚úÖ Solution Applied**:

- Removed the problematic Azure App Service config setting step from workflow
- GitHub Actions service principal only has deployment permissions, not configuration management
- Now relying on build-time environment variable compilation (more secure approach)

### üîß **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED: Clear Conflicting Environment Variables**

The malformed URLs with commas suggest multiple environment variable sources in Azure:

```
https://campuspe-api-staging-hmfjgud5c6a7exe9.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api,https://campuspe-api-staging-hmfjgud5c6a7exe9.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net/api/jobs
```

**You need to manually clear conflicting environment variables in Azure Portal:**

1. **Go to Azure Portal** ‚Üí App Services ‚Üí campuspe-web-staging
2. **Navigate to**: Configuration ‚Üí Application settings
3. **Look for these variables and DELETE them if they have multiple values**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (if it contains commas)
   - `API_URL` (if it exists)
   - Any other API-related variables with comma-separated values

4. **Set clean values** (if needed):

   ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://campuspe-api-staging-hmfjgud5c6a7exe9.southindia-01.azurewebsites.net
   NODE_ENV = production
   PORT = 80
   ```

5. **Save and restart** the App Service

### üéØ **CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

- **‚úÖ Permissions error fixed**: Workflow will no longer fail on config setting
- **‚úÖ Build verification added**: Will check if API URLs are correctly compiled
- **‚è≥ New deployment triggered**: Commit `184671d` just pushed
- **‚è≥ Expected completion**: ~8-10 minutes from now

### üîç **BUILD VERIFICATION**

The new workflow will show in logs:

```bash
# ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
"‚úÖ No localhost:5001 found in build files"
"‚úÖ Azure API URL found in build files"

# ‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS:
"‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: localhost:5001 found in build files"
"‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Azure API URL not found in build files"
```

### üß™ **TESTING STRATEGY**

**After deployment completes (~10 minutes):**

1. **Check deployment logs** for verification messages
2. **If build verification shows success**:
   - Test login page immediately
   - Should see clean API calls without commas
3. **If build verification shows warnings**:
   - Clear Azure environment variables manually (steps above)
   - Trigger new deployment

### üöÄ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

**The malformed URLs are caused by**:

- Azure App Service has multiple environment variable sources
- Possibly from previous manual configuration + GitHub Actions attempts
- Environment variables getting concatenated with commas

**The solution is**:

- Clean build-time compilation (what we're doing now)
- Manual cleanup of conflicting Azure environment variables
- Single source of truth for API URL configuration

### ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Monitor current deployment** (~10 minutes)
2. **Check build verification logs** for API URL compilation status
3. **If needed**: Manually clear Azure environment variables
4. **Test login functionality** once deployment succeeds

---

**This approach is more robust and secure - environment variables compiled at build time rather than runtime configuration management.**
