## üìä Entity Relationship Design

### Core Entities
```
Tenants (Colleges) ‚Üê‚Üí Users ‚Üê‚Üí Student/Recruiter/College Profiles
                 ‚Üì
Companies ‚Üê‚Üí Jobs ‚Üê‚Üí Applications ‚Üê‚Üí AI Match Scores
                 ‚Üì
Resume Analysis ‚Üê‚Üí Vector Embeddings ‚Üê‚Üí Recommendations
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation Strategy
- **Tenant-per-schema**: Each college gets isolated schema for compliance
- **Shared infrastructure**: Common tables for companies, global jobs
- **Cross-tenant matching**: Controlled via permission matrix

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Database Scaling Strategy

**Partitioning Approach:**
```sql
-- Time-based partitioning for high-volume tables
applications_y2024, applications_y2025 -- By submission date
audit_logs_m202401, audit_logs_m202402 -- Monthly for compliance
outbox_events (daily partitions) -- Event-driven architecture
```

**Indexing Strategy:**
```sql
-- Composite indexes for complex queries
idx_jobs_active_deadline_score -- Active jobs with AI scoring
idx_students_skills_cgpa_year -- Student search optimization  
idx_applications_status_timeline -- Application workflow tracking

-- Vector indexes for AI/ML
idx_resume_vector_cosine -- Semantic resume search
idx_job_description_vector -- Job matching algorithms
```

### Sharding Strategy (Future)
```
Shard Key: tenant_id (college_id)
- Shard 1: Tier-1 colleges (IITs, NITs) - High performance
- Shard 2: Private universities - Standard performance  
- Shard 3: Regional colleges - Cost-optimized
```

## ü§ñ AI/ML Integration Architecture

### Feature Store Design
```sql
-- Real-time feature computation
ai_match_scores (job_id, student_id, overall_score, skill_match, experience_match)
resume_analyses (student_id, extracted_skills, confidence_scores)
job_recommendations (student_id, recommended_jobs, match_reasons)
```

### Vector Embedding Strategy
- **Resume vectors**: 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings
- **Job description vectors**: Semantic job matching
- **Student profile vectors**: Holistic candidate representation
- **Company culture vectors**: Culture fit scoring

### ML Pipeline Integration
```sql
-- Event triggers for real-time ML
CREATE TRIGGER new_application_ml_scoring 
  AFTER INSERT ON applications
  FOR EACH ROW 
  EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_ai_matching();
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance Architecture

### Field-Level Encryption
```sql
-- PII encryption using pgcrypto
first_name_encrypted BYTEA -- pgp_sym_encrypt(value, key)
ssn_encrypted BYTEA -- Government ID numbers
financial_data_encrypted BYTEA -- Salary, compensation
```

### GDPR Compliance Framework
```sql
-- Right to be forgotten implementation
data_anonymization_log (user_id, anonymization_method, verification_hash)
-- Automatic data retention policies
audit_logs (retention_until DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '7 years')
```

### Row-Level Security Policies
```sql
-- Multi-tenant data isolation
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
  USING (tenant_id = current_tenant_id());

-- Role-based access control  
CREATE POLICY recruiter_student_access ON student_profiles
  USING (has_application_permission(current_user_id(), id));
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization Strategy
```sql
-- Materialized views for expensive calculations
college_placement_stats -- Real-time placement analytics
company_hiring_metrics -- Recruiter performance dashboards
student_ranking_matrix -- AI-powered candidate rankings
```

### Caching Architecture
- **Redis L1 Cache**: Session data, user preferences (< 1ms)
- **Application L2 Cache**: Job listings, company profiles (< 10ms)  
- **CDN L3 Cache**: Resume files, static assets (< 100ms)

### Connection Management
```yaml
# PgBouncer Configuration
max_client_conn: 10000      # Handle massive concurrent load
default_pool_size: 500      # Per-database connection pool
server_idle_timeout: 600    # Connection lifecycle management
```

## üîÑ Event-Driven Architecture

### Outbox Pattern Implementation
```sql
-- Reliable event publishing
outbox_events (aggregate_id, event_type, payload, status)
-- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
job_queue (job_type, payload, retry_count, max_retries)
```

### Event Types
- `student.profile.updated` ‚Üí Trigger AI re-scoring
- `job.posted` ‚Üí Send notifications to matching students  
- `application.submitted` ‚Üí Start AI screening workflow
- `interview.scheduled` ‚Üí Multi-channel notifications

## üìä Analytics & Business Intelligence

### Real-Time Dashboards
```sql
-- Executive KPI views
CREATE VIEW platform_health AS
SELECT 
  tenant_count,
  active_jobs,
  daily_applications,
  placement_rate,
  ai_matching_accuracy
FROM live_metrics;
```

### Machine Learning Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Click-through rates on recommendations  
- **Business Metrics**: Time-to-hire, candidate quality scores
- **System Health**: Query performance, error rates

## üöÄ Deployment & Migration Strategy

### Zero-Downtime Deployment
```bash
# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
deploy_core_tables.sql      # Tenants, users, basic profiles
setup_partitioning.sql      # Automated partition management
