## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Enhancements** (`/register/student`)
```tsx
// New state for resume handling
const [resumeFile, setResumeFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [resumeUploading, setResumeUploading] = useState(false);
const [resumeAnalysisId, setResumeAnalysisId] = useState('');

// Resume upload handler
const handleResumeUpload = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // File validation and state management
};

// Resume analysis integration
const uploadAndAnalyzeResume = async () => {
  // Upload to /api/students/upload-resume
  // Return analysis ID for registration
};
```

### **Backend API** (`/api/students/upload-resume`)
```typescript
// Multer configuration for file handling
const upload = multer({
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 5MB
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    // PDF, DOC, DOCX validation
  },
});

// Resume upload endpoint
router.post('/upload-resume', upload.single('resume'), async (req, res) => {
  // File processing and analysis initiation
});
```

### **Registration Data Enhancement**
```typescript
const registrationData = {
  // ... existing fields
  profileData: {
    // ... existing profile data
    resumeAnalysisId: resumeAnalysisId || null, // 🆕 New field
  }
};
```
