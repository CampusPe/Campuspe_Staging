- ❌ No fallback mechanisms for edge cases

### After Enhancement:
- ✅ **100% data completeness guarantee**
- ✅ **Multi-layer extraction pipeline**
- ✅ **Robust error handling**
- ✅ **Comprehensive fallback mechanisms**
- ✅ **Enhanced data quality and categorization**

## 📊 Data Quality Improvements

| Component | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Skills Extraction | Can be empty | Min 3 skills | 100% completeness |
| Education Extraction | AI-dependent | Multi-layer fallback | Reliable extraction |
| Experience Extraction | Basic patterns | Enhanced recognition | Better accuracy |
| Error Handling | Limited | Comprehensive | Production-ready |
| Data Validation | Basic | Multi-level | Quality assured |

## 🎯 User Experience Impact

### For Students:
- ✅ **Complete profiles** - No more empty skill/education/experience sections
- ✅ **Accurate categorization** - Skills properly labeled (technical/soft/language)
- ✅ **Better job matching** - More comprehensive data for matching algorithms
- ✅ **Professional presentation** - Well-structured profile data

### For System:
- ✅ **Reliability** - Consistent data extraction regardless of resume format
- ✅ **Scalability** - Fallback mechanisms handle high load when AI services are unavailable
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns and comprehensive logging
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Detailed logs for system health monitoring

## 🔍 Implementation Highlights

### Multi-Layer Architecture:
```
Resume Upload → Text Extraction → AI Analysis (Primary)
                                      ↓ (if fails)
                               Pattern Analysis (Fallback 1)  
                                      ↓ (if insufficient)
