## ðŸš€ **Frontend Updated for AI-Powered Resume Analysis**

### âœ… **Changes Made**

1. **API Endpoint Updated** (`/apps/web/utils/api.ts`):
   - Changed `STUDENT_ANALYZE_RESUME` from `/api/students/analyze-resume` to `/api/students/analyze-resume-ai`
   - Now points to our comprehensive AI-powered endpoint

2. **Response Handling Updated** (`/apps/web/components/ResumeUpload.tsx`):
   - Updated to handle new response structure: `response.data.analysis` instead of `response.data.data`
   - Enhanced error handling to extract specific error messages from AI endpoint
   - Better timeout and network error handling

3. **Frontend Data Processing** (`/apps/web/pages/dashboard/student.tsx`):
   - Added support for new AI response structure with structured skills objects
   - Converts new skill format `[{name, level, category}, ...]` to legacy string array for UI compatibility
   - Maps AI analysis metadata to UI fields:
     - `analysisMetadata.suggestedJobCategory` â†’ `category`
     - `jobPreferences.experienceLevel` â†’ `experienceLevel`
     - `analysisMetadata.extractionMethod` â†’ `analysisQuality` (AI-Enhanced vs Standard)
     - `analysisMetadata.confidence` â†’ confidence percentage display
   
### ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

**Previous Flow:**
```
PDF Upload â†’ Old Endpoint â†’ Basic Analysis â†’ Limited Skills â†’ Database (not updating)
```

**New Flow:**
```
PDF Upload â†’ AI Endpoint â†’ Comprehensive Analysis â†’ Structured Data â†’ Database (full update)
```

### ðŸ“Š **Expected User Experience**

When a user uploads a PDF resume now:

1. **File Upload**: User selects PDF file
2. **AI Processing**: File sent to `/api/students/analyze-resume-ai`
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: 
   - PDF text extraction
   - Claude AI analysis (with fallback)
   - Skills across all categories (technical, operational, business, soft)
   - Personal info extraction
   - Experience and education parsing
   - Job preferences inference
4. **Database Update**: Complete student profile updated
5. **UI Feedback**: 
   - Shows analysis confidence (e.g., "85% confidence")
   - Shows skill count (e.g., "Found 23 skills across operational categories")
   - Shows analysis quality ("AI-Enhanced" vs "Standard")
   - Shows profile completeness percentage

### ðŸ”§ **Testing Your Fix**

Try uploading the PDF again. You should now see:

1. **Console Logs**:

   Found 23 skills across operational categories. 
   Skills: Warehouse Operations, Logistics, Inventory Management, Quality Control, Safety Protocols, ...
   Analysis confidence: 85%. Profile completeness: 90%
   ```

3. **Database Update**: Check the student collection - should now have:
   - `resumeText`: Complete PDF text
   - `skills`: Array of skill objects with levels and categories
   - `experience`: Structured experience entries
   - `education`: Structured education entries
   - `jobPreferences`: Inferred preferences
