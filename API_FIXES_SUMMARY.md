# API Fixes and Enhancements Summary

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Recruiter Jobs Endpoint (500 Error)
**Problem**: Frontend calling `/api/jobs/recruiter-jobs` which didn't exist
**Solution**: Added new endpoint in `apps/api/src/routes/jobs.ts`
```typescript
router.get('/recruiter-jobs', authMiddleware, checkRecruiterAccess, async (req, res) => {
  // Returns jobs for authenticated recruiter
});
```

### 2. Missing Interview Assignments Endpoint (404 Error)
**Problem**: Frontend calling `/api/interviews/student/assignments` which didn't exist
**Solution**: 
- Added endpoint in `apps/api/src/routes/interview-slots.ts`
- Mounted interview routes under `/api/interviews` namespace in `app.ts`

### 3. Student Applications Endpoint Issues (400 Error)
**Problem**: Poor error handling in `/api/students/applications`
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling and authentication checks in `getStudentApplications`
